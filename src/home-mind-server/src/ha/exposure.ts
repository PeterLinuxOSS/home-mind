/**
 * The set of entities exposed to Assist, cached and shared.
 *
 * Home Assistant's own conversation agent decides what an assistant may see and
 * touch from exactly one list — `async_should_expose` in
 * `homeassistant/components/homeassistant/llm.py` filters `states.async_all()`
 * before anything downstream sees it, and the survivors are what both the
 * prompt and the live-context tool are built from. An entity the user has not
 * exposed is therefore not "cheaper to reach"; it does not exist for the
 * assistant at all.
 *
 * This object is that list, read once per TTL and handed to everything that
 * needs it: the topology scanner for the prompt, the HA client for the tools.
 * Before it existed the two disagreed — the layout honoured the user's choices
 * while `search_entities` went straight to `/api/states` and returned all 7,600
 * entities of the house, so the model could read and drive things the user had
 * deliberately kept out of Assist.
 *
 * "No opinion" is a real answer and is not the same as "expose nothing": an old
 * Home Assistant, a token without websocket access, a network error, or a user
 * who has exposed nothing all yield `null`, and `null` means do not filter. The
 * alternative — a failed websocket call leaving the assistant unable to see a
 * single device in the house — is far worse than the leak it would close.
